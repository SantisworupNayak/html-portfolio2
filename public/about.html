<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Heyy I'm Bitu.A new-bee web developer.I'm not a pro coder but can be called a toddler in the codding field.
  I'm a student of ITER college(SOA university ),Bhubaneswar,Odisha,India. </p>

  <p>This is basically my first html website. I feel really joyful to learn something productive in my vacations.
    I proudly admit that under my  mentor Miss Angela Yu,I could accomplish this much.
   Building a website through HTML isn't that difficult as it sounds to be. Only things it requires is concentrating on lectures
   and a lots of practice pf course.Once u start to understand things then there will be no going back.
